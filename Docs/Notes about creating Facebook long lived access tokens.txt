I'm using these for server side testing. I.e., for the XCTests within the server.

1) I'm using the "Create sharing invitation" mechanism of the SyncServer iOS testing app. You first sign in as an owning user, creating the sharing invitation, then redeem it as a sharing (e.g., Facebook) user.

2) When you first redeem the sharing user or subsequently sign in as the sharing user, a long-lived access token is sent back to the client. Save that. I'm putting those in ServerTests.json

3) You can see if the app is authorized here: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications

4) I was having problems trying to create long-lived access tokens for two separate Facebook accounts. It seems what I need to do is to use two different devices or two different simulator instances. And run the SyncServer iOS testing app on both of those, one for each account. I was having problems trying to get the first account authorized, and then sign-out of the first, to authorize the first. But, it seems that signing out of the first deauthorizes it. Deauthorizing its long-lived access token. Whoops.

5) I just learned one more thing: Facebook allows test user accounts-- https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1878607642387498/roles/test-users/

I just created one: npjxqwhgom_1513727437@tfbnw.net

I initially had assumed these were long-lived. But, no. After a day I had to generate a new one.
