apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

This broke with:

error: nonWhitelistedFlags("Non whitelisted flags found: [\"-fabi-version=2\", \"-fno-omit-frame-pointer\"] in pc file mysqlclient")
	What the heck is this?

In /home/crspybits/Dropbox/Ubuntu/SyncServerII/SwiftySyncServer-Github/Server/Packages/mysqlclient-2.0.1/ PADockerfile I found:
sed -i -e 's/-fabi-version=2 -fno-omit-frame-pointer//g' /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/mysqlclient.pc
	And while this seems very hacky, I changed used that script to change the .pc file given.

Here is what was changed:
23c23
< Cflags: -I${includedir} 
---
> Cflags: -I${includedir} -fabi-version=2 -fno-omit-frame-pointer

Then what happened? Did I rerun the apt-get? Hmmm. Perhaps it was the `swift build` that was failing. One way to test this would be to revert back the change above, and see if I get back the original error.
