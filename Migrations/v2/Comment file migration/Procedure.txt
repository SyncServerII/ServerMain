1. From Google Drive on my Mac, I made a copy of SharedImages.Folder onto my desktop
2. I had the script "commentMigration.py" also on my Mac OS Desktop
3. Open a terminal window so I'm in the SharedImages.Folder on my desktop
4. In that terminal window:
	python3 ~/Desktop/commentMigration.py

This is what I see for output:

Migrating comments from 2021-01-28 00:00:00 to 2021-05-27 00:00:00
Warning: File didn't contain JSON: Not attempting migration: IMPORTANT_README.txt
124 migrations successfully applied
470 migrations not applied (e.g., not in date range)

Then, I did the same thing in my live Google Drive folder.
