SyncServer

Version 0.13.0
	* Add: File name extensions in cloud storage
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/10

Version 0.12.1 (2/4/18)
	* Fixed long-standing bug in Google Drive file download-- where file would get interpreted as JSON if it contained JSON, but actually we needed data. Download would fail in that case. 
	* Also fixed corresponding problem with Dropbox download.

Version 0.12.0 (2/4/18)
	* Added a test case for version returned in headers.
	* Added userId to response when creating a user and when checking creds for a user.
	
Version 0.11.1 (2/1/18)
	* Added server version to response headers so client can defend itself against incorrect server versions.

Version 0.11.0 (1/14/18)
	* Added multi-version files
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/12
	* Fixed a long-standing bug in error handling in certain cases of problems with a deviceUUID
	* Fixed a long-standing bug: Was allowing a file to be uploaded when it was was previously deleted.
	* Added upload undeletion-- to deal with conflict resolution on clients.
	
Version 0.10.0 (1/7/18)
	* New response type for uploads-- response fields now in a header key.
		This to deal with iOS client issues for background downloading.
	
Version 0.9.0 (12/29/17)
	* Upload response now includes actual dates used.
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/44
	* Healthcheck improvements
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/32
		Added a test for this.
	* Removed dropboxClientId, dropboxClientSecret from Constants.swift-- these are not used. Dropbox doesn't require server-specific creds.
	* Added `deployedGitTag` to Constants.swift
	* Improved tracking of internal server statistics.
	
Version 0.8.1 (12/24/17)
	* Updates to testing-- getting testing script working better.
	* More updates to testing-- getting tests to work without failing.
	* New Dockerfile for building-- based off of standard Docker image
	
Version 0.8.0 (12/17/17)
	* Using ServerConstants.HTTPOAuth2AuthorizationCodeKey instead of ServerConstants.GoogleHTTPServerAuthCodeKey
		- This is going to require an iOS app update-- the prior version isn't going to work.
	* Adding Dropbox authorization and cloud storage access.
		- Using Swift/Kitura credentials Dropbox authorization from 
			https://github.com/crspybits/CredentialsDropbox.git
		- Added test cases for this
	* Package.swift is now using Swift 4 format.
	* Added `runTests.sh` script to make running tests easier. As part of this:
		- Added `jq` to Dockerfile image for building SyncServer
		- Generalized test cases and removed some to make adding other cloud storage services
			and other account sign-ins easier.
		- TestSuites.json is the file that describes all of the tests run by runTests.sh
	* Removed unused code and related tests: NSObject+Extras.swift
		Seems that changes in Swift broke this and I'm not using those methods any more.

Version 0.7.7 (12/2/17)
	* Fixed issue: When doing DoneUploads for upload deletions, previously I was using the params.currentSignedInUser!.userId and not the effective user id to lookup info in the FileIndex. As a result, when sharing users did an upload deletion, the files got marked as deleted in the file index, but didn't get deleted from cloud storage.
	
Version 0.7.6; 11/25/17
	* Added dev ops files & script -- to create application bundles for Elastic Beanstalk deployment.
	* Lots of related dev ops changes (no changes to the server code itself).
	
Version 0.7.4; 11/9/17
	* Added devops files; getting tests running on Docker.

Version 0.7.3; 10/7/17
	* Added comments, log output
	* Added parameter to nginx.conf to fix upload size limit bug. See 	
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/35

Version 0.7.2; 9/19/17
	* Added missing `==` overload.

		See https://crspybits.github.io/SyncServerII/nginx.html

Version 0.6.1; 9/2/17
	* Fixed issue: Google auth code was being sent to server when an owning user account was created, but was not being converted to a refresh token and saved.
	
	* Set logging level to DEBUG.

Version 0.6; 8/9/17-- Bug fixes
	* Don't store additional creds info for Google shared users
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/13
	
	* Make sure there is at least one cloud-storage sign-in in config when server starts
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/9
		
	* Use server-side date/time for file creation dates
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/4
		(Also necessitated removal of date keys for requests for UploadFile, and hence an update
		to the SyncServer-Shared library, to version 2.0.0).
		
	* Refresh token not saving result to mySQL
