	* Adding push notifications (APNS) using AWS SNS.

Version 0.19.1 (12/8/18)
	* Fixing issue where sharing users couldn't update (refresh and save to database) owning user access token.
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/89
		
12/2/18
	* Now have CloudWatch integrated; no new server version.
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/94

Version 0.19.0 (12/1/18)
	* Force iOS client app update
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/71
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/67

Version 0.18.6 (11/23/18)
	* Improved "gone" case in DoneUploads-- now this will occur in fewer situations.
		Should be only when a sharing user, who's owning user was removed, tries to upload
		a v0 file.

Version 0.18.5 (11/23/18)
	* Dealing with a "gone" case in DoneUploads.

Version 0.18.4 (11/22/18)
	* Added debugging/logging output code.
	
Version 0.18.3 (11/19/18)
	* Returning gone for file downloads via a normal response-- to also return app meta data
		to client.

Version 0.18.2 (11/18/18)
	* Changed reason type for gone response endpoints that use sharing group uuid's.

Version 0.18.1 (11/11/18)
	* Download endpoint returns HTTP status gone when a file has been removed/renamed.
	* Endpoints now return HTTP status "gone" when an owning user's access token has expired or been revoked. 
	* Endpoints returning "gone" now also have a reason field in the return result.
	* For Version 0.18.*, the following apply:

		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/63
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/93
	
Version 0.18.0 (11/4/18)
	* Removing byte sizes from server/database; replacing with checksums.
	* Enabled download endpoint to return the checksum for the file currently in cloud storage so a client can (a) check it against the last uploaded file checksum, and (b) check for network transmission errors.
	* Index endpoint returning cloud storage type per file, and per sharing group (for purely sharing users).
	* Fixed a longstanding issue, where some failures were not detected, in the Select function.
	* Upload endpoint must have checksum for the file being uploaded for the type of cloud storage for the file.
	* Download endpoint now also returns "contentsChanged" flag.
	
Version 0.17.4 (9/23/18)
	* Removed a consistency check across upload operations. Now allowing for the possibility of a client interleaving uploads from different sharing group UUID's (without an intervening DoneUploads) to give the client more flexibility. E.g., this could help in some client error recovery use cases.

Version 0.17.3  (9/16/18)
	* Fixed git tagging issue.
	
Version 0.17.2 (9/15/18)
	* Added ability to do sharing group update (name change) along with the DoneUploads endpoint. This was needed by the iOS client.
	
Version 0.17.1 (8/26/18)
	* Now have sharing group ids created by client to make client interface consistent.

Version 0.17.0 (8/21/18)
	* Multiple sharing groups per user
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/27
	* Add name to sharing groups.
	* Repurposed FileIndex endpoint to also return the current users sharing groups.
		Dropped the get sharing groups endpoint.
		Renamed FileIndex to Index because it's more than just for files.
	* Added other endpoints to support multiple sharing groups:
		Create sharing group, remove sharing group, remove user from sharing group, update sharing group.
		
Version 0.16.3 (7/22/18)
	* Fixed issue with user deletion.
	
Version 0.16.2 (7/22/18)
	* Added new test case & new version of shared library.

Version 0.16.1 (7/16/18)
	* Added endpoint to get sharing group ids.

Version 0.16.0 (7/15/18)
	* Ownership of files by original uploading user
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/76

Version 0.15.1 (6/20/18)
	* Fixing an issue with Docker-- used wrong base image.
	
Version 0.15.0 (6/20/18)
	* Bringing up to date with current Kitura and PerfectlySoft
	* Update CredentialsDropbox, SyncServer-Shared, SMServerLib, and (my fork of) Perfect-MySQL
		Now using actual master branch of Perfect-MySQL-- my PR got merged.
	* Now using Swift version 4.1.2 (seems required by current Perfect libs)
	* Updated Docker build and runtime to Swift 4.1.2
	
Version 0.14.1 (4/21/18)
	* Added file group UUID's to file uploads and file index-- to enable client to upload/download files in groups.
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/59
		
Version 0.14.0 (4/5/18)
	* Multi version app meta data per file
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/60
		This is a breaking change because if you upload a change to the app meta data, you need to also increment the app meta data version.
		Removing appMetaData from the FileIndex result because it's redundant with that in the file download, and the new endpoints.
		Adding new endpoints:
			DownloadAppMetaData
			UploadAppMetaData
			
Version 0.13.1 (3/1/18)
	* Updated Amazon Linux version in environments
	* Standardized return value on cloud storage upload and finding file already exists.
	* Added tests.
	
Version 0.13.0 (2/25/18)
	* Add: File name extensions in cloud storage
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/10
	* “Constant” files— that don't download
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/46
		I'm doing this by adding a single initialization "README" type of file to owning user accounts when they are first created.
	* Only send the cloud folder name when owning accounts are created
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/64
		
Version 0.12.1 (2/4/18)
	* Fixed long-standing bug in Google Drive file download-- where file would get interpreted as JSON if it contained JSON, but actually we needed data. Download would fail in that case. 
	* Also fixed corresponding problem with Dropbox download.

Version 0.12.0 (2/4/18)
	* Added a test case for version returned in headers.
	* Added userId to response when creating a user and when checking creds for a user.
	
Version 0.11.1 (2/1/18)
	* Added server version to response headers so client can defend itself against incorrect server versions.

Version 0.11.0 (1/14/18)
	* Added multi-version files
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/12
	* Fixed a long-standing bug in error handling in certain cases of problems with a deviceUUID
	* Fixed a long-standing bug: Was allowing a file to be uploaded when it was was previously deleted.
	* Added upload undeletion-- to deal with conflict resolution on clients.
	
Version 0.10.0 (1/7/18)
	* New response type for uploads-- response fields now in a header key.
		This to deal with iOS client issues for background downloading.
	
Version 0.9.0 (12/29/17)
	* Upload response now includes actual dates used.
		https://github.com/crspybits/SharedImages/issues/44
	* Healthcheck improvements
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/32
		Added a test for this.
	* Removed dropboxClientId, dropboxClientSecret from Constants.swift-- these are not used. Dropbox doesn't require server-specific creds.
	* Added `deployedGitTag` to Constants.swift
	* Improved tracking of internal server statistics.
	
Version 0.8.1 (12/24/17)
	* Updates to testing-- getting testing script working better.
	* More updates to testing-- getting tests to work without failing.
	* New Dockerfile for building-- based off of standard Docker image
	
Version 0.8.0 (12/17/17)
	* Using ServerConstants.HTTPOAuth2AuthorizationCodeKey instead of ServerConstants.GoogleHTTPServerAuthCodeKey
		- This is going to require an iOS app update-- the prior version isn't going to work.
	* Adding Dropbox authorization and cloud storage access.
		- Using Swift/Kitura credentials Dropbox authorization from 
			https://github.com/crspybits/CredentialsDropbox.git
		- Added test cases for this
	* Package.swift is now using Swift 4 format.
	* Added `runTests.sh` script to make running tests easier. As part of this:
		- Added `jq` to Dockerfile image for building SyncServer
		- Generalized test cases and removed some to make adding other cloud storage services
			and other account sign-ins easier.
		- TestSuites.json is the file that describes all of the tests run by runTests.sh
	* Removed unused code and related tests: NSObject+Extras.swift
		Seems that changes in Swift broke this and I'm not using those methods any more.

Version 0.7.7 (12/2/17)
	* Fixed issue: When doing DoneUploads for upload deletions, previously I was using the params.currentSignedInUser!.userId and not the effective user id to lookup info in the FileIndex. As a result, when sharing users did an upload deletion, the files got marked as deleted in the file index, but didn't get deleted from cloud storage.
	
Version 0.7.6; 11/25/17
	* Added dev ops files & script -- to create application bundles for Elastic Beanstalk deployment.
	* Lots of related dev ops changes (no changes to the server code itself).
	
Version 0.7.4; 11/9/17
	* Added devops files; getting tests running on Docker.

Version 0.7.3; 10/7/17
	* Added comments, log output
	* Added parameter to nginx.conf to fix upload size limit bug. See 	
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/35

Version 0.7.2; 9/19/17
	* Added missing `==` overload.
	
Version 0.7.1; 9/12/17
	* Version bump on Shared library to fix http response header issue.
	
Version 0.7.0; 9/8/17
	* Made SSL using Kitura optional. 
		See https://crspybits.github.io/SyncServerII/nginx.html

Version 0.6.1; 9/2/17
	* Fixed issue: Google auth code was being sent to server when an owning user account was created, but was not being converted to a refresh token and saved.
	
	* Set logging level to DEBUG.

Version 0.6; 8/9/17-- Bug fixes
	* Don't store additional creds info for Google shared users
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/13
	
	* Make sure there is at least one cloud-storage sign-in in config when server starts
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/9
		
	* Use server-side date/time for file creation dates
		https://github.com/crspybits/SyncServerII/issues/4
		(Also necessitated removal of date keys for requests for UploadFile, and hence an update
		to the SyncServer-Shared library, to version 2.0.0).
		
	* Refresh token not saving result to mySQL
