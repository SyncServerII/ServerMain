My general work-flow is to use Xcode for all my editing needs for the server code. And for more than a couple of lines of change, I first do:
	./Tools/clean.sh
	./generateXcodeproj.sh
	
This is so that I can get a clean build (but not run) the server. This helps me getting rid of syntax errors. I am running the server only under Docker and Linux.

I've been having problems regenerating the Xcode project using the generateXcodeproj.sh script. These are coming in two types:

1) I haven't gotten a successful build with Xcode 10 yet. This may be because of Swift 4.2, I'm not sure.

2) With Xcode 9.4.1, I'm having problems with building PerfectMySQL. The first problem was that I'd messed my MySQL installation and it wasn't finding headers. I had to arm wrestle with that for a while to fix it. Memory serving, my current fix is to (a) install with homebrew (cannot use latest mySQL -- has to be mySQL 5.7 at most-- see https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MySQL), and (b) soft link (ln -s) the includes into the right place. The second problem, I'm still struggling with. It's failing to find the link library for mySQL: 
	"ld: warning: Auto-Linking library not found for -lmysqlclient"
	
OK-- So, here's what finally seemed to have worked:

	brew install mysql@5.7 && brew link mysql@5.7 --force
	./Tools/clean.sh 
	./generateXcodeproj.sh 

I've got a clean build again.
