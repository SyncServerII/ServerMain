#!/bin/bash

# Purpose: Creates an application bundle for upload to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk, for running SyncServer
# Usage: ./make.sh [run | failover] <DockerImageTag> <file>.json [<environment-variables>.yml]
# Give "run" if you want to run the server normally.
# Give "failover" if you want the load balancer to always return an HTTP 503 to go
#   into a failover mode.
# :<DockerImageTag> is appended to the image name given in Dockerrun.aws.json (see the raw.materials folder)
# The .json file will be used as the Server.json file to start the server.
# The environment variables are a little tricky. See the README.txt in this folder.
# WARNING: I believe AWS doesn't do well with Server.json files that have blank lines in the technique I'm using to transfer the file to the Docker container.
# Assumes:
#	That this script is run from the directory the script is located in.
#	That the `jq` command line program is installed (e.g., brew install jq); see also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24942875/change-json-file-by-bash-script

# Examples: 

# Neebla production server
# ./make.sh run 0.21.2 ../Environments/neebla-production/Server.json ../Environments/neebla-production/configure.yml

# SharedImages production server
# ./make.sh run 0.7.7 ../Environments/sharedimages-production/Server.json ../Environments/sharedimages-production/configure.yml

# SharedImages staging server
# ./make.sh run 0.7.6 ../Environments/sharedimages-staging/Server.json ../Environments/sharedimages-staging/configure.yml

# iOS Client testing server
# ./make.sh run 0.14.0 ../Environments/syncserver-testing/Server.json ../Environments/syncserver-testing/configure.yml
